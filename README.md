# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes and predicts the presence of heart disease using a binary classification model applied to the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis and improve decision-making in healthcare.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `HeartDisease.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualizations.
- `HeartDisease_Cleaned.ipynb`: Cleaned version of the notebook for GitHub rendering without metadata widget issues.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset**, which includes the following key features:

- `age`: Age of the patient
- `anaemia`: Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
- `creatinine_phosphokinase`: Level of CPK enzyme in the blood
- `diabetes`: Whether the patient has diabetes (boolean)
- `ejection_fraction`: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction
- `high_blood_pressure`: Whether the patient has high blood pressure (boolean)
- `serum_sodium`: Level of sodium in the blood
- `sex`: Gender of the patient

## 🔍 Key Features

- Descriptive statistics and data visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC
- Support for feature importance analysis and cross-validation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Purpose

This notebook was developed as part of a computer science capstone project to demonstrate the application of machine learning in solving real-world problems in the healthcare domain.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and results.
3. Modify or extend the model with additional techniques as needed.
